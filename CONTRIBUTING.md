## Development

After cloning, just run tests - venv is created automatically:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/krisrowe/monarch-access.git
cd monarch-access
make test
```

### Make Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `make test` | Run unit tests (auto-creates venv, no credentials needed) |
| `make integration-test` | Run integration tests (requires Monarch token) |
| `make install` | Install CLI + MCP server with pipx |
| `make clean` | Remove venv and build artifacts |
| `make uninstall` | Remove from pipx |

### Testing

**Unit tests** use a local provider with TinyDB - no network or auth required. Test data is auto-generated from `tests/fixtures/test_data_seed.json`.

**Integration tests** hit the live Monarch API and are skipped automatically if no token is configured.

```bash
make test              # Unit tests only (default)
make integration-test  # Live API tests (requires token)
```

## Architecture

- **`config.py`**: Centralized config/token path management with env var overrides
- **`client.py`**: Auth and generic `_request()` for GraphQL calls
- **Operation modules** (accounts.py, categories.py, transactions/*.py): API calls and formatting
- **`cli.py`**: Thin Click wrapper over operation modules
- **`mcp/server.py`**: MCP server exposing same operations to AI assistants

## Architecture Notes

This project follows a CLI/MCP/SDK layered architecture:
- **SDK layer** (`monarch/*.py`): Business logic, reusable
- **CLI layer** (`monarch/cli.py`): Thin Click wrapper
- **MCP layer** (`monarch/mcp/`): Thin MCP wrapper exposing SDK to AI assistants

## Monarch API Behaviors

Observations from working with the Monarch Money GraphQL API. These are not documented by Monarch — they're discovered through testing. Introspection queries are disabled for non-admin users, so mutation names and input shapes must be reverse-engineered.

### Two Recurring Query Types

Monarch has two separate GraphQL queries for recurring data:

| Query | Returns | Payment status? | Credit report liabilities? |
|-------|---------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| `Web_GetUpcomingRecurringTransactionItems` | Date-specific occurrences (many per stream) | Yes (`isPast`, `transactionId`, `date`, `category`, `account`) | No |
| `Common_GetRecurringStreams` | One entry per stream (catalog) | No | Yes (with `includeLiabilities: true`) |

Everything in the first query is a subset of the second. The second is a superset that also includes inactive/stale streams and credit report liabilities.

### Credit Report Liability Streams

Streams sourced from credit bureau data (not transaction detection). These have:
- `merchant: null` — no merchant association
- `amount: null` — no fixed payment amount (balance varies)
- `recurringType`: `credit_card`, `expense` (mortgages), or `credit_line`
- `creditReportLiabilityAccount` with: `status` (OPEN/CLOSED), `accountType` (MORTGAGE/REVOLVING/CREDIT_LINE/INSTALLMENT), `reportedDate`, and linked `account` with balance

Fields NOT available on credit report liabilities (all return 400): `lastStatementBalance`, `minimumPayment`, `lastPaymentAmount`, `dueDate`, `creditLimit`, `apr`, `monthlyPayment`.

The Monarch UI displays payment amounts and due dates for these streams, but the API doesn't expose how those are derived — likely from account statement data or transaction history.

### Merchant-Level Recurring

Recurring streams are controlled through the **merchant** resource:
- Each merchant has a recurring flag (on/off), amount, and frequency
- Toggling recurring on a merchant creates streams; toggling off removes ALL streams for that merchant
- One merchant can have multiple streams (different detection patterns from varying payee names)
- The `markStreamAsNotRecurring(streamId)` mutation removes a stream but affects all streams for its merchant

### Merchant Data Staleness

When a loan transfers between servicers (e.g., from one mortgage company to another), Monarch's merchant may retain the old loan's amount and recurring settings. The new servicer creates a new merchant with its own detection. The old merchant's data becomes stale but is never automatically cleaned up.

### Duplicate Streams

Monarch creates separate streams when the same payee's transaction description varies (e.g., different abbreviations, location suffixes, or "Memorial" vs regular entries). These are the same real-world obligation but appear as 2-3 separate streams.

### `last_paid_date` Null Behavior

In the collapsed stream output, `last_paid_date: null` means no transaction was matched to any occurrence in the trailing 12-month window. This could mean:
- The stream is genuinely stale (no payments ever or account closed)
- The payment comes from an account not linked to Monarch
- The merchant name changed and payments now post under a different merchant
- The account credential is disconnected and transactions stopped syncing

The null is ambiguous — consumers should investigate rather than assume "never paid."

### Third Recurring Query: Aggregated Items

`Common_GetAggregatedRecurringItems` is what the Monarch UI actually uses for its Upcoming/Complete view. It returns BOTH merchant-based AND credit report liability items in one response, grouped by status. Key fields not available in the other queries:

- `isLate` — whether the item is past due
- `isCompleted` — whether payment is confirmed
- `liabilityStatement.minimumPaymentAmount` — the minimum payment due (this is where the UI gets payment amounts for credit cards and mortgages)
- `liabilityStatement.paymentsInformation.status` — paid/unpaid/partially_paid
- `liabilityStatement.paymentsInformation.remainingBalance` — balance after payments
- `liabilityStatement.paymentsInformation.transactions[]` — actual payments applied

This query is captured in `queries.py` as `AGGREGATED_RECURRING_ITEMS_QUERY` but not yet wired to SDK/MCP/CLI.

### Discovered Mutations

Schema introspection is disabled. All mutations were reverse-engineered from the Monarch web app via Chrome DevTools.

**Recurring stream removal:**
- `markStreamAsNotRecurring(streamId: ID!)` — permanently removes stream. Affects all streams for the merchant. Request only `success` — requesting `errors` sub-fields causes HTTP 400. Implemented in SDK/MCP/CLI.

**Merchant update:**
- `updateMerchant(input: UpdateMerchantInput!)` — update merchant name and recurring settings. Input shape:
  ```json
  {
    "input": {
      "merchantId": "...",
      "name": "...",
      "recurrence": {
        "isRecurring": true,
        "frequency": "monthly",
        "baseDate": "YYYY-MM-DD",
        "amount": -123.45,
        "isActive": true/false
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  Setting `isActive: false` deactivates the stream (reversible). Setting `isRecurring: false` removes it. All `recurrence` fields must be sent every time — partial updates not supported. Implemented in SDK/MCP/CLI via `update_recurring`.

**Merchant logo (3-step process):**
1. `getCloudinaryUploadInfo(input: {entityType: "merchant"})` — returns signed upload params (timestamp, folder, signature, api_key, upload_preset)
2. POST to `https://api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/monarch-money/image/upload/` — multipart form with image file + signed params
3. `setMerchantLogo(input: {merchantId, cloudinaryPublicId})` — associates uploaded image with merchant

The `cloudinaryPublicId` from an existing merchant can be reused on other merchants to share logos. Captured in `queries.py` but not yet wired to SDK/MCP/CLI.

**Merchant queries:**
- `merchants(search: String)` — search merchants by name. Returns id, name, logoUrl, transactionsCount, canBeDeleted, createdAt, recurringTransactionStream.
- `merchant(id: ID!)` — get single merchant by ID. Returns additional fields: transactionCount, ruleCount, hasActiveRecurringStreams.

Both captured in `queries.py` but not yet wired to SDK/MCP/CLI.

### Multi-Account Merchant Splitting

When one merchant (e.g., an insurer) handles multiple policies from different accounts, transactions can be reassigned to new merchants:

1. Use `update_transaction(id, merchant_name="New Name")` — Monarch auto-creates the merchant if it doesn't exist
2. Set up recurring on the new merchant via `updateMerchant`
3. Copy logo via `setMerchantLogo` with the original's `cloudinaryPublicId`
4. Deactivate the original merchant's recurring

This workflow is proven and uses existing implemented tools for steps 1-2, plus captured-but-not-yet-implemented mutations for steps 3-4.
